The protesters planned to march to Mayor Lori Lightfootâ€™s home, some of them calling for her resignation.The event was largely peaceful, though some police and protesters scuffled as the night drew to a close.In the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, protesters staged the sixth straight night of demonstrations outside the police headquarters. Smaller demonstrations also occurred in downtown Minneapolis.Authorities had initially declined to declare an evening curfew, after quieter protests on the previous two nights. But after clashes between protesters and police in Brooklyn Center, during which authorities claimed a fence around the heavily fortified police headquarters was breached, an unlawful assembly was declared and 100 arrests were made.Earlier in the evening, a US district judge ruled that Minnesota state patrol could not arrest, threaten or target journalists after an ACLU complaint that law enforcement was unfairly cracking down on working reporters.But on Friday night a number of reporters documented being detained by police and released only after being photographed by officers with their press identification badges.Meanwhile, a protest that began peacefully in California ended with multiple fires set, several cars damaged and numerous windows shattered.The protest against police brutality in Oakland began calmly on Friday night, news outlets reported. A subsequent march drew about 300 people.", return_tensors="pt")

It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk.[20] In the context of business and management, finance deals with the problems of ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives; i.e. that it: (1) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and (2) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments. Finance also deals with the long term objective of maximizing the value of the business, while also balancing risk and profitability; this includes the interrelated questions of (1) capital investment, which businesses and projects to invest in; (2) capital structure, deciding on the mix of funding to be used; and (3) dividend policy, what to do with excess capital.", return_tensors="pt")
